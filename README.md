# joke-book-cover-generate
Generates a cover in the style of the *Cambridge studies in advanced mathematics* series of books, for joke use

Cambridge University Press owns the copyright of the original cover. To avoid copyright issues, don't use it for commercial purposes!

## Usage:
```shell
python generate.py <Your-Cover-Title> <Author> [Font]
```
The font should be installed in the system.
Default font is `adobe-source-han-sans/SourceHanSansCN-Heavy.otf`, if you don't have it and you don't give the program another, will throw an error.
